**Functions in TypeScript**
Functions are basic building block of any application, whether they're local functions,or imported from another modules/ methods on a class. 

As we have created a function here, it will use `any` datatype which is an issue. This is because we would be able to use the `string`, `boolean`, etc. values here.

Whole idea behind TypeScript is to make a Stricter type. I know it sounds a bit cringe, but IT IS WHAT IT IS !!.

Hence, the best way to define a function is to just assign the datatype to the variable/parameter while declaring it.
