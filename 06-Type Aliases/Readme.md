**Type Aliases**
It refers to create a `custom type` and passing that type as a new data type inside a function. You will get a better understanding looking at the code. Creating a type is same as creating a `const`. The syntax is:
```bash
    type {aliasName} = {
        variable: {type};
    }
```
Using typeAliases the type is exactly an `any` type.
