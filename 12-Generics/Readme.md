**Generics in TypeScript**
Generics allow creating type variables which can be used to create classes, functions & type aliases that don't need to explicitly define the types that they use. They make it easier to write reusable code.

#### Functions
Generics with functions help make more generalized methods which more accurately represent types used and returned.

#### Classes
Generics can be used to create generalized classes, like Map.
