**Casting in TypeScript**
Casting is a the process of overriding a type. We can use casting in the following ways:

#### Casting with `as`:
A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the `as` keyword, which will directly change type of given variable.

#### Casting with `<>`:
It works the same as casting with `as`.

#### Force Casting:
To override type errors that TypeScript may throw when casting, first cast to `unknown`, then to target type.
